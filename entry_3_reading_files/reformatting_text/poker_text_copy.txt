An Argument against No-Limit Holdem

I have no idea why No Limit Holdem is so popular.
It has always been, and will always be, a game for
total nits - (in poker jargon, a nit is a player
who does not play many hands).  Moreover, it is
the game that provides the greatest edge for
experienced and professional players.  As a
result, most rooms devolve into a den of regulars,
sheltering miserable card sharps who nab each
other's big blinds at a snail pace.

Superior poker variants abound: deuce-to-seven
triple draw, omaha hi lo, short-deck.  The list
goes on, seemingly ad infinitum.  Not only do
these games encourage more entertaining play, but
they also reduce the skill edge of the experienced
players, fostering a more recreational, laid back
atmosphere.

That no poker room offers a slate of these games
is nothing short of a travesty.  Poker is so much
bigger than one game.
