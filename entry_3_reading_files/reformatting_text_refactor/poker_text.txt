An Argument against No-Limit Holdem

I have no idea why No Limit Holdem is so popular.  It has always been, and will always be, a game for total nits - (in poker jargon, a nit is a player who does not play many hands).  Moreover, it is the game that provides the greatest edge for experienced and professional players.  As a result, most rooms devolve into a den of regulars, sheltering miserable card sharps who nab each other's big blinds at a snail pace.

Superior poker variants abound: deuce-to-seven triple draw, omaha hi lo, short-deck.  The list goes on, seemingly ad infinitum.  Not only do these games encourage more entertaining play, but they also reduce the skill edge of the experienced players, fostering a more recreational, laid back atmosphere.

That no poker room offers a slate of these games is nothing short of a travesty.  Poker is so much bigger than one game.
