# Combinations Continued

In our first entry, we used recursion to generate all possible combinations of
pocket twos from a standard, fifty-two card deck.  It served as a nice
introduction to some core features of the language - type signatures, function
definitions, and recursion.  

Although it served as a nice introduction, we can simplify the code outlined in
combinations_1.   In fact, we can return all combinations k taken from a
collection n in a single line, without recursion.  For example, consider the
list of integers zero to three. 

```
nums = [(x,y) | x <- [0..3], y <- [x..3], x /= y]
```

Printing nums to standard output will show that we have exhausted all possible
combinations of numbers zero through three.  We can visualize the comprehension
in the following manner:

> x = 0; y = 0,1,2,3 => ~~(0,0)~~, (0,1), (0,2), (0,3)
> x = 1; y = 1,2,3 => ~~(1,1)~~,(1,2), (1,3)
> x = 2; y = 2,3 => ~~(2,2)~~,(2,3)
> x = 3; y = 3 => ( )

## The Subscript Operator
We can apply this same concept to a list of strings.  For example, we can use
the subscript operator - !! -  in conjunction with the comprehension logic
outlined in nums to arrive at all combinations of pocket twos.

```
twos = ["2c","2d","2h","2s"]
pocketTwos = [(twos !! x, twos !! y) | 
		        x <- [0..length twos - 1], 
		        y <- [x..length twos -1], 
		        x /= y]
```

The subscript operator returns the value associated with an index.  Therefore,
passing x and y to the subscript operator will return their concomitant twos.

## Data.Map

As outlined on Hoogle, a Haskell API search engine,  the subscript operator is
a partial function, meaning it is not capable of handling all possible arguments.
Alternative functions are often recommended in lieu of !! to avoid runtime errors.
Bound errors - requesting an index value that is not present in the list - are
a common side effect of index operations across programming languages.
Alternatively, we can use one of Haskellâ€™s implementations of a hash map - a
collection of key => value pairs - to arrive at the same collection of twos.

```
deuces = Map.fromList (zip [0..] twos)
pocketTwosSnd = [(fromMaybe "0" (Map.lookup x deuces), fromMaybe "0" (Map.lookup y deuces)) | 
                		x <- [0..length deuces - 1], 
                		y <- [x..length deuces - 1], 
                		x /= y] 
```

First, we create a list of tuples of the type [(Integer, String)].  This is
accomplished by passing two lists to the zip function, which pairs elements
from two lists until one of the lists is exhausted.  In our case, numbers zero
through N are paired with the string representations of twos.  This list of
tuples is then passed to the fromList function to generate our hash map,
"deuces." 
  
Once our hash map has been instantiated, we use our comprehension logic to
create a list titled pocketTwosSnd, although the information before the guard
is slightly more involved than with the subscript operator.

The Map type returns two values - "just" and "nothing," otherwise known as
"maybe" types.  The former indicates that the key exists in the Map, while the
latter indicates the opposite.  For instance, "Map.lookup 0 deuces" returns
"just 2c," of type "maybe String."
  
We can retrieve the underlying value associated with "maybe" by calling the
function fromMaybe.  fromMaybe retrieves "just" values from the map, returning
a default output - in our case "0" - in the event that "nothing" is found.
 
In summary, pocketTwosSnd composes a tuple by calling the lookup function, once
with x and once with y, and passing the results to fromMaybe.

And there you have it.  Some alternative solutions for counting ducks.
