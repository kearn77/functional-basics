# Repository Goals

The goal of this repository is to chronicle my progress with functional 
programming and the Haskell programming language.  To that end, I will 
endeavor to commit code snippets to the repository as frequently as possible, 
with a focus on solving targeted, manageable problems with Haskell 
fundamentals.  

Moreover, I will include supplemental text explaining my analysis of the code 
and the problems at hand.  These projects will be contained within directories 
of the form "entry_x_y", where x is the entry number and y is a description of 
the problem.

Iâ€™m a functional programming novice.  Hopefully, other beginners can learn 
something from my trials and tribulations, or simply laugh at the many 
pratfalls that are sure to come.

Regardless, thanks for reading!
